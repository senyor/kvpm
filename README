Kvpm is a KDE GUI for the Linux Volume Manager project and
libparted. It uses the standard lvm tools and programs to work with
logical volumes. It also can format volumes and mount them. I hope to
add in the ability to repartition drives with libparted at some point.


The following development headers need to be 
installed for compilation: 

libparted version 1.8
libblkid
kdelibs version 4
<sys/mount.h>


To compile the source just "cd" into the source directory then run
"cmake -i" and answer the questions. Next run "make" and if all goes
well you will have a working executable.  Kvpm is being developed with
recent versions of the lvm programs and may not work with older ones.

***
Known major bug: Currently kvpm doesn't search for the LVM programs
such a "vgs." It simply expects to find them in /sbin and will fail if
they aren't there.
