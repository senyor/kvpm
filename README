Kvpm is a KDE (version 4) GUI for the Linux Volume Manager project and
libparted. It needs KDE 4 libraries and headers installed. It uses the
standard lvm tools and programs to work with logical volumes. It also
can format volumes and mount them. I hope to add in the ability to
repartition drives with libparted at some point.

This program is currently being developed on lvm version:

#lvs --version
  LVM version:     2.02.39 (2008-06-27)
  Library version: 1.02.27 (2008-06-25)
  Driver version:  4.13.0



Because kvpm relies on the exact format of the lvm program
output it probably won't work correctly with earlier versions.

The following development headers need to be 
installed for compilation: 

libparted version 1.8
libblkid
kdelibs version 4
<sys/mount.h>


To compile the source just "cd" into the source directory then run
"cmake -i" and answer the questions. Next run "make" and if all goes
well you will have a working executable.
