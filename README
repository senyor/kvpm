Kvpm is a KDE (version 4) GUI for the Linux Volume Manager project and
libparted. It needs KDE 4 libraries and headers installed. It uses the
standard lvm tools and programs to work with logical volumes. It also
can format volumes and mount them. I hope to add in the ability to
repartition drives with libparted at some point.

This program is currently being developed on lvm version:

#lvs --version
  LVM version:     2.02.33 (2008-01-31)
  Library version: 1.02.24 (2007-12-20)
  Driver version:  4.12.0

Because kvpm relies on the exact format of the lvm program
output it probably won't work correctly with earlier versions.

The following development headers need to be 
installed for compilation: 

libparted version 1.8
libblkid
kdelibs version 4
<sys/mount.h>


To compile the source just "cd" into the source directory then run
"cmake -i" and answer the questions. Next run "make" and if all goes
well you will have a working executable.


The progress bar doesn't really work, but that appears to
be a bug in KDE 4.0, from the report I found.

The program looks for the executables such as vgs and mkfs
in /sbin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. If 
the binaries are elsewhere, edit the file "executablefinder.cpp."
The path is searched in the order given.


For example:

    search_path << "/sbin/"
                << "/usr/sbin/"
                << "/bin/"
                << "/usr/bin/"
                << "/usr/local/bin/";

Could become:

    search_path << "/mybins/"
                << "/usr/sbin/"
                << "/bin/"
                << "/usr/bin/"
                << "/usr/local/bin/";

Note: Don't forget the trailing slash!
