Kvpm is a KDE (version 4) GUI for the Linux Volume Manager project and
libparted. It needs KDE 4 libraries and headers installed. It uses the
standard lvm tools and programs to work with logical volumes. It also
can format volumes and mount them. It is now possible to create and
delete partitions. Moving and resizing partitions or logical volumes is
now supported too.


This program is currently being developed on lvm version (with library lvm2app):

lvs --version
  LVM version:     2.02.73(2)-cvs (2010-07-28)
  Library version: 1.02.54-cvs (2010-07-28)
  Driver version:  4.15.0


Because kvpm relies on the exact format of the lvm program
output it won't work correctly with earlier versions.

The following development headers need to be 
installed for compilation: 

lvm2app.h
libparted version 1.8
libblkid
kdelibs version 4
<sys/mount.h>


To compile the source just "cd" into the source directory then run
"cmake -i" and answer the questions. Next run "make" and if all goes
well you will have a working executable.
