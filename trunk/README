Kvpm is a KDE (version 4) GUI for the Linux Volume Manager project and
libparted. It needs KDE 4 libraries and headers installed. It uses the
standard lvm tools and programs to work with logical volumes. It also
can format volumes and mount them. It is  possible to create, delete,
move or resize partitions.


This program is currently being developed on lvm version (with library lvm2app):

lvs --version

  LVM version:     2.02.95(2) (2012-03-06)
  Library version: 1.02.74 (2012-03-06)
  Driver version:  4.22.0


Because kvpm relies on the exact format of the lvm program output and 
the presence of the new library "lvm2app" it won't work correctly with 
earlier versions.

udev and udevadm must be installed too.

The following development headers need to be 
installed for compilation: 

lvm2app.h
libdevmapper.h
libparted version 2.3 or higher
libblkid
kdelibs version 4
<sys/mount.h>
<linux/fs.h>

The file: /proc/self/mountinfo must also be present. It was introduced
in linux kernel version 2.6.26.

NOTE: If you compile a new version of lvm and devmapper, libparted 
also links to libdevmapper and may need to recompiled. I have been 
using parted v2.3 but v3.0 should also work now.

To compile the source just "cd" into the top directory, the one with
"CHANGELOG," and type "cmake ." with the space and period after
it. Next run "make" and "make install" if all goes well you will have
a working executable.

Translation files are in the "po" subdirectory.
