version 0.9.3
Added support for displaying thin pools and volumes.
Put in a new dialog for creating thin volumes and snaps.

version 0.9.2
Added support for raid1, raid4, raid5 and raid6. 
Added support for the 'contiguous' policy in all dialogs that have
a policy option. Normal has always been supported. 

version 0.9.1
Improved pvmove dialog with regard to mirrors and snapshots by making the
not movable parts clearly labeled.

version 0.9.0
Made compiling faster by removing #include <QtGui> everywhere. Added
more calls to QLabel->setBuddy() to improve mouse-less usage. Reformattede
code with program "astyle" to make it more consistent. Improved consistency
of dialog appearance too.

version 0.8.6
Fixed immediate crash when group is clustered. Fixed configuration dialog
buttons to work more as a user would expect. /etc/mtab permissions don't get
mangled now.

version 0.8.5
It is now possible to cancel a running mkfs process and some other long
running process should follow soon. Sizes may now be specified in traditional
powers of two (1KiB = 1024) or in powers of ten (1KB = 1000) SI units.

version 0.8.4
Added to, and improved, the configuration dialog. Property panels can now
be configured. Changed the detection of mounted filesystems to use
/proc/self/mountinfo rather than the depracated /etc/mtab file. Fixed
a bug that deleted symlinked /etc/mtab and replaced it with a real file.

version 0.8.3
Added new configuration options and made showing some panels optional.
Improved the appearance of the properties panels and made them look
more consistant with the overall look.

version 0.8.2
Added a splash screen and moved the progressbar to the mainwindow
menubar. Improved the dialog for adding a mirror leg or changing
a mirror log.

version 0.8.1
Improved and added to the kvpm config options.

version 0.8.0
Added icons for most menus. Added several more for the Tree lists
of physical volumes, logical volumes and devices to show mount state,
active status and missing volumes in partial groups. Improved cmake 
commands for "make install."

version 0.7.8
Added a menu option for running 'fsck -fp' on a filesystem.
Removed call to ped_file_system_clobber() which is no longer
supported by libparted.

version 0.7.7
Changed lvcreate to allow the extention of snapshot origings by
shutting them down then extending the lv, reactivating and extending
the filesystem.

version 0.7.6
Added more selections to the mkfs dialog such a setting inode size and
many other advanced options.  The lv size chart graphic now is
presented in the same order as the volumes appear in the volume group
tree even when the tree sort order is changed. Added a new column in
the pvtree showing the use/ignoring of metadata areas in a
pv. pvchange can set the use or ignoring of metadata and generate a
new pv uuid. There is now a dialog for merging snapshots.

version 0.7.5 
Re-worked and debugged add partition dialog. Changed the code for
selecting the size to a separate object that contains a line edit,
combo box and slider(replacing the spin box).  Aligned the device tree
view to right alignment with centered headers like the vgtree. Added
support for basic usage of ntfs file systems.

version 0.7.4
Added a menu option for removing the filesystem from a logical
volume just as it was already possible to do with a partition.

version 0.7.3
Added a small docbook handbook and some icons. More bugfixes.
The filesystem operations menu now has a dialog for extending
a filesystem to fill its underlying volume.

version 0.7.2
Snapshots now are nested in the tree like mirror legs. 
Compressed all the seperate vgchange dialogs into one. Changed 
the volume group tree widget to keep the same trees expanded
or collapsed when the widget gets updated. Added a column
to show the metadata areas on the physical volumes and their
size.

version 0.7.1
Replaced missing include in "lvrename.h" and fixed
the "remaining" column in the first tab. It was reporting
blocks and not bytes.

version 0.7.0
Many internal fixes. LVM now supports resizing mirrors
so that was added along with mirrored mirror logs and multi
segment mirrors. library lvm2app is now used and required.
Btrfs is supported along with volume group splitting and 
merging.

version 0.6.2
Shrinking and growing physical volumes is now supported.
Filesystems can be removed from partitions now. Removed the
menu item for rescanning only one volume group. It was causing
crashes but may be added back when I have time to do it 
right.

version 0.6.1
The filesystem grow and shrink parts of PartMoveResize
have been moved out of that object and put into their
own files. lv reduce now looks at the minimum shrink 
size for a filesystem. A simple setup function was added
to set the kvpm configuration to something sensible the 
first time kvpm is run. 

version 0.6.0
Partitions can now be moved and resized for ext2 and ext3
filesystems. The "fsck" program is now required too.

version 0.5.5
The kvpm "settings" dialog can set the column hidden/show for
both of the tree views and save it in the config file.

version 0.5.4
The volume group creation dialog can be called from
the "volume group" menu now and create new groups
from multiple physical volumes.

version 0.5.3
The settings menu is partly implemented. The search 
path for the needed programs such as "vgs" can be 
configured.

version 0.5.2
mount points are on the main tree view now.
New and blingy "create partition" graphic
like "gparted" has to show the size of a partition
about to be created along with the free space around
it.

version 0.5.1
The panels get a more finished look and small
areas (under 1 MiB) of free space are not shown
anymore.

version 0.5.0
Can create a new partition table.
Better support for GPT disk labels and
a visual make over of the device tab. 
Needs cmake version 2.6 or better.
Adds and removes partitions from partition table.

version 0.4.6
Added calls to i18n() for support of translation
to other languages. Some bug fixes and work to
the mount and unmount operations to allow for
overlayed mounting. Help menu for bug reporting 
improved.

version 0.4.5
Added new dialogs to import and export volumes
groups.

version 0.4.4
The lvproperties widgets have a little bit diffent
look now. Small bug fixes. Lvcreate now has a name
validator.

version 0.4.3 
Added more information the the pvproperties widgets. 
They now use a QTableWidget to show the extents 
used by each logical volume. Added an new function,
lvrename, which does just that.

version 0.4.2
Fixed a bug that caused random crashes after 
mounting/unmounting and certain other operations.
The mirror corelog option of lvcreate should work
now. 

version 0.4.1
Still doing coding style unification and hunting
down small bugs. Extending non-linear volumes should
work better now.

version 0.4.0
More additions for handling mirrors. The "properties"
widgets improved again and background colors made to
match. Many bug fixes.

version .3.3
Lots of bug fixes. Volume group information display
changed again, much nicer now.

version .3.1
Changes to the handling of mirrors, still not done.
Copyright notice debugged.
Many coding style improvements and bugs fixed.
Volume group information display changed but still
needs improvement.
